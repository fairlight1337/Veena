# Veena - SVG to PNG batch converter

This is a simple Qt based SVG to PNG batch converter. It has a GUI that accepts files via drag and drop, allows to set the desired width and height of the resulting PNG files made from source SVGs, and shows its progress while it converts the files.

When starting the process, it asks for a destination directory. All converted files will be placed there, maintaining their original filename (except for the extension, obviously).

Existing files will be overwritten.
